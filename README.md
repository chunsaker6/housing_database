# Housing Database

This is a housing database. The database came from Kaggle. It is housing information from Washington state. 

## Features

- **Interesting Queries**: I created a few interesting queries such as: Average price of 3 bedroom, Calculate average price per square foot in a particular area(zip code), Price of home compared to amount of floors and Average price at given latitude/longitude based on all homes within a 1 mile radius.
- **Data Input**: Used a python script to import the data into a CSV and upload it to our database.
- **Progress Visualization**: Users can visualize their progress over time through a progress report comparision between workouts and by uploading before and after photos.
- **Customized Workout**: Users have customized workouts from a highly experienced personal trainer.
